This is a visual interface for a territory expansion game that I created some time ago. This game was initially conceived as a large-scale Discord game in which players would provide their daily actions, they would be performed, and the map would be edited in Photoshop by the person running the game to reflect the changes made.

Soon after, however, it became clear that such a system would be extremely time-consuming, especially as a daily exercise. So I decided to put my computer science degree to the test to try to program an interface for this game in Godot, which is what you see now.

This game is by no means in any sort of playable state, and will likely remain in semi-active development for some time.
